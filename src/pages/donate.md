**{{ PROJECT_NAME }}** is a forever-free project run by [Casey Ocampo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caseyocampo/). She is committed to making this website a resource for all developers interested in making web accessibility a part of their craft and practice.

If A11y-oop has helped you gain real-world web accessibility knowledge that you feel confident writing (and even teaching!), then I'd ask you to consider making a donation if you have the capacity to.

Donations like yours keep this website alive, maintained, and updated!

Thanks for taking the time. And {{ description }}!

&ndash; Casey
