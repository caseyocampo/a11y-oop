**A11yoop** is a project created by [Casey Ocampo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caseyocampo/), an Accessibility Engineer who is committed to making this website a web accessibility resource for developers.

Web accessibility can be a tricky topic to approach. Most web development tutorials overlook accessibility. Often, the basics of accessibility like alt text or color contrast are left out. More "advanced" topics like aria attributes are virtually never mentioned unless it's an accessibility specific tutorial. This leaves developer the questions of "where to even start learning of accessibility?".

The goal for A11yoop is to make it as easy a possible to learn web accessibility concepts by writing accessibility tips in plain English with references to the [WCAG 2.1 Understanding Docs](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/) linked where appropriate. Tips are broken down into "basic" and "advanced" categories.

This project is a completely free forever resource that I hope makes developers more confident in the subject and application of web accessibility.
